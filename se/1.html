			<h2 class="ui header">Background</h2>
			<p>In year 2092, the Earth population exploded, reaching 14 billion. The government created a program to reduce the population of Earth by
sending their family into space into random direction hoping of landing into a planet and creating new colony. This successfully reduce the
population of Earth by 80%, or around 2 billion.</p>
			<p>People are sent in family basis, so all of individual is sent through random planet with all of their family and usually there's around 50-75
family for each launch vehicle. The vehicle is launched from Earth with speed of 92% speed of light (where speed of light is 299792458 m/s) into
random direction. The vehicle is only meant to be single shot and has everything the colony need to build and sustain a new colony. Despite they
are sent into random direction, due to many factors they may land in same planet as the other colonies. Peoples inside the vehicle are hibernated
and only woken up once it lands on a planet. Some of these colonies even going beyond Milky Way galaxy.</p>
			<p>The whole process took thousand years, which then interstellar travel becomes very common because the technology to send signal and travel
faster than speed of light has been found. While some colonies have decided to sent their report into Earth, some colonies decided to threaten the other
colonies, which introduces a new type of war: Interstellar War.</p>
			<p>These wars rarely happen. When the war started, the Earth noticed that they'll lose communication with most of the planets and only connected to
5% of the colonies. The Earth didn't know what's happend while the war is going on and once Earth regain communication, the war already ended
and the affected planet becomes almost inhabitable. It is unknown which coloines are behind the war. Some says it's because some of the colonies
doesn't want to transported to other planet, and some colonies wants to take over all the planet, including Earth since the beginning.</p>

			<h2 class="ui header">Story 1</h2>
			<p>A thousand years later, to be exact, year 4682, a former Interstellar Army (IA), AuahDark decide to took break and live happily with his wife
Natasya in his own private space station situated in Vianir star system with no habitable planets around and mostly gas giants with his own space ship to
travel around different star system. Until one day his space station got attacked by unknown people. Natasya saves AuahDark by directly protecting
him and teleporting him directly to his ship and remotely control it, where AuahDark can't do anything other than watching his space station destroyed,
killing his wife. The space station exploded and the shockwave is hard enough to knock him out inside, and along with his ship.</p>
			<p>Few hours later, with his ship was flying blind, he finally wakes up to found himself almost hitting the ground straight. His ship is badly
damaged, so he only able to glide for a brief moment before crashing into a surface of a habitable planet in unmapped star system. The planet is a jungle
planet with lots of trees and fresh breathable air.</p>
			<p>In that planet, AuahDark decided to build a shelter near his crashed ship and stay for a while until his wound completely recovered. The
animals and plants there are mostly edible by him as he taught how to survive in a planet while he was still in IA. With help from tools in his space ship,
he's able to sustain the wild life on that planet. He realize that repairing his ship is not possible, so he plan to explore the planet instead. Three days
later, after his wound completely recovered, he decide to explore the planet and see if there are other people in the planet.</p>
			<p>Night comes with the beautiful <a href="http://bandori.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Lapse" target="_blank">starry sky</a>, AuahDark sees the stars
while wondering why their space station got attacked. Not until he hear someone screaming in pain from afar. AuahDark rush immediately to the source of the
scream, but sees troops guarding the place and a space ship. AuahDark then enters the area in stealthy way and then he sees someone who's held captive.
Unfortunately one of the troops enters the room which causes all the troops to be alerted, so AuahDark have no choice to kill them all. With some wounds,
AuahDark decided to kill all people and release the person who was held captive before. He then tells AuahDark that his name is Chrono then he asks AuahDark
to use the space ship that AuahDark was previously sees when entering the area.</p>
			<p>However once he left the planet atmoshere, they're chased by few ships which attackes them. AuahDark asks if there are weapon in this ship
and Chrono says yes, but he notes that it doesn't have much ammo remaining. AuahDark just smile, turn around the ship and go into space ship battle. Chrono
is impressed with AuahDark skills. AuahDark then asks whete to bring him, then he replies to bring him to planet Utpala located in Rolpdamo star system.
While they're on the way, Chrono asks AuahDark how he's very skilled fighting all the people and controlling the space ship. AuahDark then replies
that he was a former IA personnel who had his private space station destroyed by unknown people.</p>
			<p>AuahDark then asks Chrono why he can end up in that planet, then Chrono says that while the last Interstellar War was going on, he decided
to check the communication problem on the affected planet. When he goes to the one of the affected planet, his communication to the planet Utpala also lost
so he think there was some kind of interference going on. He landed on the affected planet, and while he try to find the reason why the signal is lost,
he was kidnapped by some troops, with his ship too, and he brought to the jungle planet earlier. Chrono then consider AuahDark as lucky because those
troops seem doesn't go investigate his ship in time.</p>
			<p>After reaching Rolpdamo star system, AuahDark is warned by his instruments that the signal coverage is limited to receiving only and it's
entering unmapped star system. Chrono then tells AuahDark that Rolpdamo is unique that the star emits radio signal which interfere with the "sending"
frequency of all Earth radio instruments. However, Chrono states that his ship has full star system mapping of Rolpdamo but he has no intention to send
the star system mapping to Earth because this star system appears as "hidden" in almost any star map instruments and all people from planet Utpala agrees
with it. Furthermore, he even states that anyone who tracks ship by their FTL drive trace will be untrackable when reaching near this star system.</p>
			<p>After reaching planet Utpala, five escort ships comes to escort Chrono's ship and bringing them to safety. On ground, local military already
waits for Chrono. After AuahDark landed the ship, Chrono is escorted to hospital by the military, but AuahDark is asked to leave the star system immediately.
Knowing that AuahDark is not come with him, Chrono stops and asks the military to let AuahDark come with him as AuahDark had saved his life.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But looking by his clothes, he's an IA, an Earth federation Interstellar Army. We can't let anyone from IA enter this planet"
- respond of Chrono's military guard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is that matter if he has kind heart? What matters more is a person who can bring a peace to the world, not a person who
discriminate people and limiting their rights." - says Chrono<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it's been a tradition of hundreds of years to isolate ourselves from people outside Rolpdamo star system" - Chrono's military
guard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shouldn't keep tradition for too long. You should move on to it. Now let him come with me." - responds Chrono</p>
			<p>In hospital, Chrono thank to AuahDark for saving him, and he's allowed to stay in planet Utpala. However, AuahDark responds to Chrono that
he doesn't need to stay in planet Utpala for long and request for new space ship instead, so he can find out who's destroy his space station and killed
his wife. Chrono then agrees to build new space ship for him, but he asks AuahDark to stay for a while until his space ship construction completed, in which
AuahDark agrees.</p>
			<p>The new AuahDark's space ship construction took a week to finish. Chrono then tells AuahDark that the new space ship construction is finished
and escort AuahDark to his new space ship. Chrono notes that the ship comes with radio that won't interfere with Rolpdamo star radiation, which allows
AuahDark to communicate with planet Utpala and other ship which is constructed in planet Utpala, including his ship. Chrono also mentions that the ship
have full Rolpdamo star system mapping but any attempt to submit the star data to Earth will be denied. Furthermore, Chrono says that the ship is designed
for exploration and combat, which means it has high mileage and bleeding-edge hi-tech weapons on board. "You'll like it" says Chrono to AuahDark. AuahDark
then hops into his new space ship and says "I can't believe I still see someone kind enough since I was IA personnel. I'll see you soon" followed by AuahDark
leaving planet Utpala and Rolpdamo star system.</p>
