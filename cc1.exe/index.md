CrossCode
=========

OwO what's this? Not a part of GCC compiler

Excuse me wtf? Okay this page is dedicated to my journey to CrossWorlds. Almost everything written here is a personal thing, may not match up with any other sources or etc.

What's CrossCode you ask? 2D 16-bit styled RPG game, you play a character named Lea and progress the journey of RPG world "Playground". I'm not gonna spoil anything in this page so I may write more pages about anything that I have in mind about this CrossWorlds in a meantime.
